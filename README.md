# spartaglobal_html_lab
First lab using html in class, we explored some basic tags, layouts and semantics.

This was a task we were alocated where we had to make a video streaming website similar to youtube.


* index page which is the main page
  * includes links to 3 videos
  * use of semantics is preferable.
