# spartaglobal_html_lab
First lab using html in class, we explored some basic tags, layouts and semantics.

This was a task we were alocated where we had to make a video streaming website similar to youtube.


* index page which is the main page
  * includes links to 3 videos
  * use of semantics is preferable.
  * use images for the video thumbnail
  * each thumbnail must have a description of the video
  * must link to page 1, 2,3.html
* page 1
  * has a header
  * has a video tag to display the video whether localy or directly from youtube
  * contains a longer description of the video
